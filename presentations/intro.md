### 1. Introduction
Your Internet experience runs on APIs. The acronym has helped you compare the best prices for flights, allowed you to embed a map into your store’s website and seamlessly processed your credit card payments. But what is an API and why does it matter to you? 

### 2. What is a Web API?
API stands for application programming interface. This is a concept in software technology that essentially refers to how multiple applications can interact with and obtain data from one another. APIs operate on an agreement of inputs and outputs.

**Application:** These can be apps that you use on your smartphone or a software program that you use.
**Programming:** Developers use APIs to write software.
**Interface:** How you interact with the application.

#### Types of APIs
***Public APIs*** are released by companies like Slack and Shopify in hopes that developers will use them to build on their platforms. The company will share a set of inputs that you can use to achieve certain outputs. For every input, they agree to give an output and the output does not differ.

You don’t need to submit your app for approval for a public API. They’re usually documented and can be accessed without too much fanfare.

***Private APIs*** are used internally at a company. If a company has multiple software products, private APIs are used for the software to “talk” to each other. The components of the APIs can change at the company’s whim, whereas a change to a public API would cause an outcry.


### 3. Why build and use a Web API?
As we mentioned earlier, your Internet experience runs on APIs. Instead of accessing four different applications or services four separate times, you may use one software to access all four at the same time.

*  **APIs Streamline Your Processes**
The Sprout Social Smart Inbox is an excellent example of this. Before, you would log into Facebook and Twitter separately, check messages, run search terms and respond when you were tagged. Now, thanks to the networks’ APIs, you can see it all in one view, cutting out on extra time.

* **Apps Make Your Life Easier**
If you use public transit, you likely have an app telling you when the next bus is arriving. The app uses the transit’s API to show which bus is arriving and when. It saves you time and possibly from freezing if you live in a cold climate.

* **Businesses Expand with APIs**
A business’ potential can be expanded when they offer an API. There are only so many resources a business can offer. Having an API available, with developers who are eager to build on them, can expand their offerings to more people.
